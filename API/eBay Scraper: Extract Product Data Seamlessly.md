## How It Works

The eBay Scraper requires two inputs from you:

1. **A Link**: Provide the search or category URL from eBay.
2. **A Proxy**: Use proxies to avoid IP bans and achieve consistent results.

### Output Formats

After completing a scrape, the results are stored in a dataset and can be downloaded in various formats, including JSON, CSV, and XML. Keep in mind that search results may vary based on location, so using proxies is recommended for consistent data retrieval.

## Proxy Usage
