## Free Google Shopping Scraper

For small-scale scraping, a free Python tool is an excellent way to get started. Follow the steps below to scrape Google Shopping data using Python.

### Requirements

Ensure you have **Python 3.11** installed on your system before running the tool.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal, navigate to the repository, and install the required packages by running:

```bash
make install
```

### Step 2: Scraping Google Shopping Data

To scrape shopping items from Google Shopping, use the following command:

```bash
make scrape QUERY="<your_shopping_search_query>"
```

For example, to scrape Google Shopping results for "cat food," run:

```bash
make scrape QUERY="cat food"
```

> **Tip:** Always enclose your search query in quotation marks to avoid parsing errors.

Once the tool runs successfully, youâ€™ll see an output in the terminal. The results will be saved to a file named `shopping.csv` in your current directory.

## Output: What's Inside `shopping.csv`?

The generated CSV file will contain the following columns:

- **`title`**: The title of the item.
- **`price`**: The price of the item.
- **`delivery_price`**: The delivery fee (if applicable).
- **`review`**: An optional field containing a rating (up to 5 stars) and the number of reviews.
- **`url`**: The URL of the Google Shopping page for the item.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the extracted data looks:
