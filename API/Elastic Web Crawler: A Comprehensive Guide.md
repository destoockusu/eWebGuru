## Availability and Prerequisites

The Elastic Web Crawler was introduced in version **8.4.0** and is available for:
1. **Elastic Cloud Deployments**: Requires Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Enterprise Search services. Ensure **at least 4 GB RAM per zone** for Enterprise Search.
   - For more details, view the [deployment infrastructure requirements](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/enterprise-search/current/deployment.html#deployment-infrastructure-requirements).

2. **Self-Managed Deployments**: Available with a valid [Elastic subscription](https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions). Check the "Elastic Search" section for specific requirements.

### Elastic Cloud IPs
If using the web crawler on Elastic Cloud, outbound data transfer (egress) may require adding static IP ranges to your firewall rules.  
Refer to the [Elastic Cloud documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-static-ips.html) for the latest IP addresses.

## Version History

### Significant Changes:
- **8.5.0**: The default ingest pipeline for newly created indices was updated to use the `body` field for binary content instead of the `body_content` field. This can affect search results if your search experiences rely on the `body_content` field.  
  **Workarounds:**
  - Update your search experiences to include the `body` field.
  - Customize the pipeline to copy content between `body` and `body_content`.
  - Verify boosts and weights for App Search engines to include the `body` field where necessary.

- **8.4.0**: The web crawler reached General Availability (GA).
