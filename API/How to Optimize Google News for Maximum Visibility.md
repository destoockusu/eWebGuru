# How to Optimize Google News for Maximum Visibility

Google News serves as a significant driver of traffic for news-based content. It's not just a platform for displaying publisher content but also a way to enhance visibility since articles from Google News can appear in general Google search results. Queries related to breaking news and current events often trigger updated results. Some articles are grouped into clusters marked "In the News," offering publishers the chance to feature their latest articles prominently on the search results page.

## Triggering Google News Features

Google News responds to multiple types of queries. Examples include:

- Natural disasters (e.g., tsunamis, earthquakes, storms)
- Attacks (e.g., school shootings, terrorist events)
- Elections, holidays, and major sports events (e.g., Olympics, World Cup, Super Bowl)
- Deaths of prominent figures or major brand announcements

For instance, searching for "ebola" triggers a news box at the top of the SERP (Search Engine Results Page), showcasing relevant content clusters.

### Evolving Inclusion Standards

Previously, news clusters only featured content from approved publishers. Starting in October 2014, Google began including other sources like Reddit, Twitter, and niche websites. This evolution broadened access to Google News features.

## Publisher Eligibility and Standards

To be featured in Google News, publishers must adhere to strict quality standards. Both acceptance and retention in the platform depend on meeting these guidelines. Here are some general requirements:

### General Requirements
1. **Contact Information**: Your website must display accessible contact information, including your organization's physical address, phone number, and email.
2. **Unique Naming**: If your publication name is common, you must differentiate it uniquely when submitting to Google News. For instance, "Star Tribune" might be submitted as "Minneapolis Star Tribune."
3. **Language Variations**: For multilingual websites, you must submit separate requests for each language version.

### Application Process
Once your website complies with all requirements, you can submit an application to Google News. Ensure your application is complete and accurate. Google's review process can take several weeks, and rejections lack detailed feedback. If rejected, you must wait 60 days before reapplying, so it's essential to get it right on the first try.

## Paid and Subscription-Based Content

Websites requiring registration or payment to access content can still appear on Google News but must be labeled appropriately. For example:

- **"Subscription" Tag**: Stories requiring subscriptions are labeled accordingly. However, these articles typically receive fewer clicks due to reduced visibility, affecting ranking performance.
- **First Click Free Program**: To mitigate this, Google offers the "First Click Free" program. Publishers participating in this program must allow Google-referred users to bypass paywalls for up to five articles per day. Beyond this limit, subscription prompts are allowed.

## Technical Requirements for Google News

Google News has stricter technical requirements compared to standard web search algorithms. Key technical guidelines include:

1. **Article Metadata**:
   - Dates and authors should appear in distinct HTML lines between the headline and article text.
2. **URL Standards**:
   - URLs must include a unique identifier with at least three digits unless submitted via a News Sitemap.
3. **Content Length**:
   - Articles must have a minimum of 80 words. Short updates or single-paragraph summaries might be excluded.
4. **HTML Size Limits**:
   - HTML source pages must not exceed 256KB. This could affect pages with infinite scrolling or extensive user comments.

## Managing Content via Google News Publisher Center

### Adding and Updating Sections
To simplify content updates, Google News Publisher Center allows publishers to add, edit, or remove section URLs. This helps publishers manage dynamic and evolving content structures efficiently.

### Maintaining Source Details
Google News requires publishers to update source information manually. For instance, if you launch a new subpage, you must notify the support team for manual updates.

## Enhancing Visibility Through Sitemaps

Google News sitemaps help index your content more effectively. While Google News uses the standard sitemap protocol, it incorporates additional tags for keywords, images, content genres, and stock tickers. Best practices for sitemaps include:

1. Upload the sitemap to your root directory.
2. Update it immediately after publishing new content.
3. Limit articles to those published within the last 48 hours.
4. Separate news content from non-news content in the sitemap.

For news sites frequently adding new sections, a dedicated sitemap enhances content discoverability and control.

## Using Metadata to Improve Ranking

### News-Specific Meta Tags
1. **news_keyword**: Include highly relevant keywords to improve article ranking.
2. **standout**: Use this tag to identify original or exclusive content. Standout tags can highlight articles requiring substantial resources or representing the original source of a story.

For standout tags:
- Use no more than seven times per week.
- Reference external articles using outbound standout citations.

## Image Optimization for Google News

Images increase article click-through rates, especially when displayed in thumbnails. Ensure the following for effective image indexing:

- Place images near article titles.
- Use inline images with descriptive captions.
- Opt for high-resolution images (minimum 60x60 pixels).

---

## Video Content in Google News

Google News accepts video content under these conditions:
- Videos must report current events and be newsworthy.
- Titles and descriptions should be specific and detailed.
- Videos must comply with copyright and geographical restrictions.

For YouTube-based video submissions:
- Use descriptive titles and categories like "News & Politics."
- Maintain clear audio and visually engaging imagery.

---

## Editorâ€™s Pick Features

Google News allows publishers to submit their best original content through "Editor's Picks." Guidelines include:

- Submit up to five articles via a custom RSS or Atom feed.
- Include only news contentâ€”no advertisements or guidance columns.
- Update the feed at least once every 48 hours.

## Conclusion

Optimizing for Google News requires meeting strict standards, both editorial and technical. From crafting unique metadata to managing dynamic content structures, success depends on following Google's detailed guidelines. By leveraging tools like Google News sitemaps and adhering to submission best practices, publishers can maximize visibility and traffic.
