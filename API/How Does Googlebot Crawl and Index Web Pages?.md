Googlebot is Google’s web crawler that collects the information needed to build its searchable web index. It comes with tools for mobile and desktop crawling, as well as specialized crawlers for news, images, and video content. Additionally, Google deploys specific crawlers for specialized tasks, each identified by a unique user-agent string.

Googlebot operates as an evergreen crawler, meaning it views websites the same way users see them in the latest version of the Chrome browser. Running on thousands of machines, Googlebot determines the crawl speed and content, ensuring it doesn’t overwhelm websites. Let’s dive into how Googlebot builds its web index.

## How Does Googlebot Crawl the Web and Index Pages?

Google has shared several versions of its pipeline over the years. Here’s the most updated process:

1. **Starting with URLs**: Googlebot begins with a list of URLs collected from various sources like pages, sitemaps, RSS feeds, and URLs submitted via Google Search Console or the Indexing API.
2. **Crawling Content**: It prioritizes content to crawl, fetches pages, and stores copies of them.
3. **Finding Additional Links**: During processing, it looks for more links, including API requests, JavaScript, and CSS required to render pages.
4. **Caching Resources**: These additional requests are crawled and cached for future rendering.
5. **Rendering Pages**: Using cached resources, Googlebot renders pages as users would see them.
6. **Indexing Content**: The rendered content is stored in Google’s index and made searchable. Any new links found are added back to the URL queue for future crawling.

## How to Control Googlebot?

Google offers several ways to control what Googlebot crawls and indexes on your site.

### 1. Controlling Crawling

- **Robots.txt**: This file allows you to specify which parts of your site Googlebot can crawl.
- **Nofollow**: Add this link attribute or meta robots tag to suggest that certain links shouldn’t be followed. Note: It’s treated as a hint, not a directive.
- **Adjust Crawl Speed**: Use Google Search Console to slow down Googlebot’s crawl rate if needed.

### 2. Controlling Indexing

- **Remove Content**: Deleting a page ensures it won’t be indexed, but it also makes the content inaccessible to everyone.
- **Restrict Access**: Googlebot can’t log in to password-protected sites or access authenticated content.
- **Noindex**: Add the `noindex` meta tag to tell search engines not to index a specific page.
- **URL Removal Tool**: Temporarily hide content from search results using Google’s URL removal tool. Google will still crawl and view the content, but it won’t appear in search results.
- **Robots.txt for Images**: Blocking Googlebot from crawling images ensures they won’t be indexed.

## How to Verify the Authenticity of Googlebot?

Many SEO tools and malicious bots can mimic Googlebot to bypass restrictions. Here’s how you can verify real Googlebot activity:

1. **Use Google’s Public IP List**: Google provides a public IP list you can compare against your server logs to confirm Googlebot requests.
2. **Google Search Console**: Access the "Crawl Stats" report under “Settings.” This report includes detailed information about how Google crawls your site, showing which Googlebot is accessing which files and when.

## Final Thoughts

The web is a vast and chaotic place. Googlebot must navigate varying settings, downtime, and restrictions to collect data for Google’s search engine. Fun fact: Googlebot is often referred to as a robot and even has a spider mascot named "Crawley."
