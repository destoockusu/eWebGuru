## What Is a SERP API?

A SERP API, or SERP scraping API (application programming interface), is an automated tool that retrieves data from search engine results pages. These APIs can scrape high volumes of data, parse it automatically, and customize the output to include only relevant information.

### What Kind of Data Can SERP APIs Retrieve?

Different SERP APIs offer varying levels of customization. For example, some APIs can extract:

- Organic results
- Paid advertisements
- Inline videos
- Snippets
- URLs
- Knowledge graphs
- Pagination details
- Related searches

### How Does a SERP Scraper API Work?
