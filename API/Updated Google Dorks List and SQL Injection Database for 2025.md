# Updated Google Dorks List and SQL Injection Database for 2025

In this article, we will explore **Google Dorks** and their usage in identifying potential vulnerabilities in web applications. SQL Injection continues to be one of the most prevalent security threats, ranking #1 in the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection). By using Google Dorks, one can uncover sensitive information like login pages, private folders, server access details, and more.

## What Are Google Dorks?

Google Dorks are advanced search queries that can reveal hidden information on websites. Hackers often use these queries in “Google Hacking” to locate vulnerabilities and sensitive data. While Google’s search engine is designed to crawl and index vast amounts of information, careless security practices can expose sensitive data, such as email addresses, login credentials, or even financial information, to the public.

### Common Security Risks
- **Data Disclosure**: Exposure of sensitive user or organizational data.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining unauthorized administrative access.
- **Identity Spoofing**: Exploiting user credentials to impersonate others.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Disrupting system availability.

## How to Use Google Dorks

To use Google Dorks, simply enter a specific query in the Google search bar and hit “Enter.” Below are examples of common Google Dorks that target various domains and information types.

### Google Dork Query Examples:
- **Search Specific Domains**:
  - `site:.edu "phone number"`: Searches for `.edu` domains containing the words "phone number."
  - `inurl:edu "login"`: Finds `.edu` login pages.
- **Forum Software**:
  - `"powered by vbulletin" site:.edu`: Finds `.edu` websites running on the vBulletin forum software.
  - `"powered by vbulletin" site:.gov`: Locates `.gov` domains using vBulletin.
- **File and Directory Listings**:
  - `intitle:index.of "backup"`: Displays directory listings with "backup" files.
  - `filetype:log inurl:admin`: Searches for log files in URLs containing "admin."
- **Sensitive Information**:
  - `filetype:sql password`: Identifies publicly accessible SQL files containing "password."
  - `filetype:env "DB_PASSWORD"`: Finds `.env` files revealing database credentials.

> **Note**: While Google Dorks are powerful, they should never be used to exploit or access unauthorized data. Misuse of this tool can lead to legal consequences.

## Avoiding SQL Injection Attacks

SQL Injection is a critical threat that manipulates SQL queries to access or modify a database. Proper security practices can prevent such vulnerabilities.

### Key Preventive Measures:
1. **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent input tampering.
2. **Validation and Sanitization**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to block malicious data.
3. **Regular Updates**: Ensure web applications and databases are regularly patched against known vulnerabilities.

> Refer to OWASP's [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) and [Query Parameterization Guide](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html) for comprehensive guidance.

## Advanced Google Search Operators

Below are commonly used operators to refine your Google search queries:

1. **`cache:`**  
   Retrieves Google's cached version of a webpage.  
   Example: `cache:www.example.com`
   
2. **`site:`**  
   Limits search results to a specific domain.  
   Example: `site:.edu "login"`
   
3. **`intitle:`**  
   Finds pages with specific keywords in the title.  
   Example: `intitle:"admin login"`
   
4. **`inurl:`**  
   Searches for keywords within a URL.  
   Example: `inurl:"/admin/"`
   
5. **`filetype:`**  
   Locates specific file types like `.pdf`, `.sql`, or `.env`.  
   Example: `filetype:pdf "financial report"`

## Version Control and Security Updates

To avoid exploitation, outdated web applications and database systems should be regularly monitored and updated. Technologies such as ASP.NET and J2EE offer more robust defenses against SQL Injection compared to older PHP-based systems.
